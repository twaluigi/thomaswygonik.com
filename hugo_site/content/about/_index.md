I'm an operations engineer at AWS. I graduated from RIT in 2018 with a degree in Computing and Information Technology. I have experience with AWS, infrastructure as code, Python, Docker, and other random things. I'm AWS Certified for SysOps Administrator - Associate, Solutions Architect - Associate, and Developer - Associate. In my free time, I mess around with my homelab and work on personal projects.
