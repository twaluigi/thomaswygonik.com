title:      How I Host this Website

---

One of the simplest ways to host a website, especially one for a blog, is to use a static site generator and hosting with GitHub pages. After looking into it, I decided I'd use of these static site generators to set up my website. There are a few options to choose from, but I settled on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll provides a simple interface with Ruby and markdown to set up your website.

I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn more about AWS and hosting, so rather than host this site on GitHub pages, I'm using AWS S3's website hosting feature.
